# YtGecko
Kotlin based project.
An attempt to make Youtube run in background without using system overlay permission. Here we have tried to run m.youtube.com inside Geckoview . Geckoview is a webview alternate power of Gecko (the engine that powers Firefox), while its API is WebView-like and easy to use. The app is completely usable, although can be considered as an Alpha since, it is very buggy. We have also played around to remove the shorts and share button for the same reason. However, share functionality for the time being, stays accessable, by long clicking any image on the page, of which the link is to be shared.
Consider under GPL license for now

Check out release to test out this app ;)
